		Metal emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a heavier and darker style of hard rock. While at first it was completely dominated by Black Sabbath, it soon grew in popularity and by the 1980s bands like Metallica and Slayer were very well known throught America and even Europe. Later in the 90s, metal began to spread in many different directions, gaining influence from alternative rock, progressive rock, and many other genres of rock. Metal even gained mainstream popularity in the late 90s and early 2000s, but this faded quickly. Metal continues to be an expansive genre that is taking influence from more and more styles of music, and pushing rock music forward.

		<h3 class="maintitle">1970s/80s: Classic Heavy Metal</h3>
		All metal can basically be traced back to one band: Black Sabbath. There were other hard rock bands that influenced the genre, such as Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin, but Black Sabbath was by far the heaviest and most inventive band within the style. It took some time for the genre to gain traction, but by the late 70s and early 80s, heavy metal was a popular style of music that would even come to reach the mainstream with more pop-oriented artists. By the mid 1980s, heavy metal had more or less been played out to its fullest, so some bands started to push the genre in an even heavier direction, incorporating shouted and screamed vocals, and even more distorted guitars. This style of metal, known as Thrash Metal, became very popular in the years leading up to the 90s.

		<h3 class="maintitle">1990s/2000s: Progressive/Alternative Metal & Metalcore</h3>
		Metal began to spread in many different directions during the 90s. With the newfound popularity of grunge and alternative rock, many bands went for an alternative sound, mixing elements like funk, progressive rock, and even rap to push metal even more towards the mainstream. However, other bands stuck to the classic heavy sound, but mixing with elements of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and even genres such as folk to truly open up metal. Meanwhile, some bands have mixed metal with hardcore punk to create metalcore, an extremely fast, heavy, and aggressive style of music with sreamed vocals and short songs, that has become popular and has remained relevant to this day.
