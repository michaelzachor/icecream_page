		Folk music actually predated rock, but this page focuses on the rock-oriented style of folk music that began in the early 1960s. Folk music is very simple, usually consisting of just a vocalist and an acoustic guitar. The lyrics are often political, but folk artists also write typical emotional lyrics about everyday life, as well as psychedelic and nonsensical lyrics. Since the genre is pretty straightforward, this site divides it into its two most successful periods: the 1960s/70s and the 21st century.

		<h3 class="maintitle">Folk in the 1960s/70s</h3>
		Folk began to mix with rock music in the mid-1960s, as artists such as the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and the Byrds mixed acoustic guitars and folk elements with full rock backing bands and electric instruments. However, there were still many artists who stuck to acoustic instruments only, singing softly over acoustic guitars and pianos. Other artists mixed folk with other styles such as blues or country to further diversify the genre. The scene mostly died out by the mid-1970s.

		<h3 class="maintitle">Folk in the 1990s/2000s/10s</h3>
		Folk music began to make a comeback in the 1990s as indie rock bands began making soft, acoustic, and lyric-based music, often mixed with lo-fi recording techniques to create a raw and emotional atmosphere. By the 2000s, though, folk artists were becoming more and more experimental, bringing together elements of psychedelic, classical, and electronic music to create a unique style of folk that has become very popular within the alternative music mainstream.
