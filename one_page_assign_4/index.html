	<h1 id="sixty_head">The 1960s</h1>

	<section id="sixty">
		<p>Popular music in the early 1960s was almost entirely based around singles rather than albums. Most critics' attention went towards jazz artists such as Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Charles Mingus, whereas the public was listening to genres like country, folk, rhythm & blues, soul, and rock & roll, which was all seen under the 'pop' umbrella. However, by the mid 1960s, rock and folk musicians such as the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and the Beach Boys had started to release albums that were meant to be experienced in full, rather than as individual songs. This shift quickly caused the entire music industry to become more album-oriented than single-oriented, which allowed popular music to be as much of an art form as jazz and other genres were in the past. Other notable artists releasing influential albums during this period were the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, Jimi Hendrix, the Velvet Underground, Frank Zappa, and Jefferson Airplane.</p>

	<section id="seventy">
		<p>Rock's move into more mature material opened the door for other genres such as soul and funk to follow suit. It also allowed the genre to expand into different areas and subgenres, depending on the talents and interests of each musician. Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, and the Who played louder and heavier to form hard rock; Black Sabbath paved the way for metal by doubling up on the guitar distortion; Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Yes, and Genesis created progressive rock by defying standard rock and pop conventions; Neil Young, Nick Drake, Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen mastered the slower, folksier side of rock; and bands in the latter-half of the decade, like the Clash, Television, Wire, Elvis Costello, Blondie, the Ramones, and the Sex Pistols combined simple compositions with rebellious energy to create punk rock. Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield, Fela Kuti, and Funkadelic were the most influential artists among the soul and funk genres, and artists like Bob Marley and the Congos were combining soul with rock to create reggae, whose subgenre 'ska' would come to influence the punk genre. In addition, as technology continued to advance, electronic music came to existence, with Kraftwerk paving the way for what would become a very popular sound in only a few years. Meanwhile, while rock was still the most popular genre in the first half of the decade, it was quickly replaced by disco by around 1977.</p>

	<h1 id="eighty_head">The 1980s</h1>

	<section id="eighty">
		<p>The 1980s saw each subgenre becoming more distinct and breaking into even more subgenres. The decade began with artists taking the energy of punk rock and adding a more complex and experimental edge to it to create post-punk, with Joy Division and The Cure taking a darker, more gothic route, while the Talking Heads led a more energetic style of post-punk that became known as new wave. Meanwhile, bands like the Smiths, R.E.M., Pixies, the Replacements, Sonic Youth, the Stone Roses, and Dinosaur Jr. were leading an alternative rock movement that remained mostly underground and independent, and therefore more free to experiment within the rock and pop genres. Outside of all this, artists like Kate Bush, Tom Waits, and Talk Talk were experimenting and pushing older genres forward while at the same time creating new subgenres entirely: progressive pop for Bush, post rock for Talk Talk, and a unique blend of jazz and folk rock. Finally, bands like Metallica and Slayer added even more distortion and energy to their music and combined that with screamed vocals and complex guitar solos to push metal in a heavier direction, which came to be known as thrash metal. Hip hop was invented in the mid 1980s, with rappers rhyming over beats mostly sampled from older songs. Artists like Public Enemy, Run-DMC, N.W.A., Beastie Boys, and De La Soul were able to create their own sounds in the genre. In the mainstream, pop music was being led by artists like Michael Jackson, Prince, and Madonna, who were making music to dance to, but adding elements of funk, gospel, disco, and rock.</p>

	<h1 id="ninety_head">The 1990s</h1>

	<section id="ninety">
		<p>Rock had remained in the mainstream throughout the 1980s, with bands like Bon Jovi and Guns N Roses combining metallic instrumentations with pop sensibilities to create a subenre called 'hair metal', but the grunge and britpop explosion in the beginning of the 1990s replaced that commercial style with the alternative rock of the 1980s. On the American side, bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden led the grunge movement, with the Smashing Pumpkins and the Red Hot Chili Peppers being influential alternative rock acts as well. In Britain, the britpop movement was less agressive than grunge, but just as popular, and bands like Pulp, Blur, and Oasis led the movement. Meanwhile, bands like Neutral Milk Hotel, Modest Mouse, Elliott Smith, Belle & Sebastian, and Pavement were taking a looser and even less commercial route, and revolutionizing the indie rock genre. Other movements included 'shoegaze', a subgenre which combined the noisy alternative rock of Sonic Youth with the ethereal dream pop of other 90s acts like Cocteau Twins and was led by My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive; a further exploration of post-rock, led by bands like Sigur Ros, Swans, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and Slint; and an experimental art rock / art pop movement led by Radiohead, Bjork and Stereolab. Metal mostly went in two directions: death metal and black metal replaced thrash metal as the fast, complex metal movement, while most other bands combined heavy metal tendencies with the alternative rock of the 80s and 90s to create an alternative metal movement which became almost as popular as alternative rock, and was led by Rage Against the Machine, Tool, and Alice in Chains. Meanwhile, hip hop was gaining more of a voice and a following, with styles varying by area: East Coast Hip Hop included the hardcore boom bap of the Notorious B.I.G., the Wu-Tang Clan, and Nas, as well as the softer jazz rap of A Tribe Called Quest and Gang Starr; West Coast Hip Hop taking the more pop-oriented style of Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and 2pac; and Southern Hip Hop (without a distinct style of its own) being led by OutKast and UGK. Electronic music was also finally becoming a genre of its own, with the most influential artists including Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, Depeche Mode, Massive Attack, and Portishead, and with subgenres including techno, ambient, and trip hop.</p>

	<h1 id="thousand_head">The 2000s</h1>

	<section id="thousand">
		<p>The popularity of alternative and indie rock in the 1990s allowed for many more artists to reach the spotlight in the 2000s than in previous decades, which makes it difficult to define a full list of the most influential artists of the decade. In addition, the ever more popular trend of combining genres also makes it difficult to separate artists by style. On the more straightforward rock side, there was a post-punk and garage-rock revival movement that consisted of bands like the Strokes, the White Stripes, and Arctic Monkeys keeping rock in the mainstream; on the folk side, artists like Joanna Newsom, Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes, Animal Collective, and Sufjan Stevens were stretching the genre to lengths it hadn't gone before; Radiohead and Bjork were continuing to experiment with electronics within the alternative genre, along with newer artists like Gorillaz, Daft Punk, MGMT, and LCD Soundsystem; within metal, progressive became the new complex subgenre, with leading artists including Opeth and Mastodon and the alternative metal genre reached its highest levels of popularity yet, with bands like Deftones and Tool leading the way. In hip hop, the differences between each coast's style mostly faded, with Kanye West, Jay-Z, OutKast, and Eminem being the most popular leaders of the genre, and other artists like MF DOOM and J Dilla leading the underground movement. </p>

	<h1 id="ten_head">The 2010s</h1>

	<section id="ten">
		<p>The 2010s, even more so than the 2000s, is incredibly difficult to divide by style of music. Digital streaming has replaced physical copies, allowing anyone with Internet access the ability to have virtually any song at their fingertips, from the earliest rock & roll tracks to the most obscure modern bands. This makes it difficult to list the most influential artists of the decade, since everybody is listening to everybody now. In addition, the increasing lengths of time that artists are taking in between albums makes it general to truly decide which artists have dominated the genre, and which were just living off their 2000s successes. In general, the 2010s have been a huge success for hip hop and rap in general, as the genre continues to grow and evolve into various different styles. Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar and Drake have been the biggest names in the genre, with other artists like Death Grips, Danny Brown, Travis Scott, Run the Jewels, Brockhampton, and ex-members of the Odd Future collective (Frank Ocean, Earl Sweatshirt, and Tyler, the Creator), releasing influential and popular albums that blur the lines between hip hop, electronic, jazz, and soul/R&B. The dream pop / psychedelic movement is receiving somewhat of a revival, with significant releases from Beach House, Deerhunter, Tame Impala, Julia Holter, and others. In addition, many indie rock musicians, such as Courtney Barnett, Mac DeMarco, and Parquet Courts are returning to a loose 90s sound, mixed with modern production. As the lines between genres continue to blur, it will be exciting to see what happens to the music industry in the 2020s.</p>
